## About Fish n Fly

I’m Mike — an angler who believes the best trips combine water, movement, and a bit of uncertainty.

Fish n Fly is where I document our travels, whether fishing is top of mind or just exploring countries, coastlines where access, timing, and local knowledge matter just as much as cultrural diversity.

This site is about:
- Traveling with fishing as the purpose
- Learning new lands
- The gear, planning, and mistakes along the way
- Stories worth telling, even when the fishing is slow
