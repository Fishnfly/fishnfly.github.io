## About Fish n Fly

I’m Mike — a traveler drawn to places that feel a little off the main route.

Fish n Fly is a travel journal focused on moving through countries, regions, and landscapes with curiosity and intention. Sometimes that involves fishing, sometimes it doesn’t — but it always involves slowing down enough to understand a place beyond the highlights.

This site is about:
- Traveling through countries, not just visiting them
- Learning how places work on the ground
- Long days, unexpected detours, and small details
- Experiences that don’t fit neatly into an itinerary

Fishing shows up here when it’s part of the story — as one way of connecting to water, people, and place — but the heart of Fish n Fly is travel itself.
