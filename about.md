title: About
---


We’re Mike and Birgitte — travelers drawn to major cities and covering all the countries in the world with some that may feel a little off the well-trodden path.

**Fish n Fly** is a travel journal shaped by movement through countries, regions, and landscapes with curiosity and intention. Sometimes that movement involves fishing, sometimes it doesn’t — but it always involves slowing down enough to understand a place beyond the highlights.

Our travels focus less on checking locations off a list and more on learning how places work on the ground. We care about how people move through their days, how landscapes shape decisions, and how plans change once you step outside the guidebook.

This site is about:
- Traveling *through* countries, not just visiting them
- Paying attention to the small details that don’t fit an itinerary
- Long days, unexpected detours, and lessons learned along the way
- Experiences that feel earned rather than packaged

Fishing appears here when it’s part of the story — as one way of connecting to water, people, and place. It’s not the focus of every trip, but when it fits, it adds texture and perspective.
