## Traveling Through Countries, Not Just To Them

Travel, for us, is about movement — across borders, through regions, and into the quieter parts of a place that don’t always show up on a map.

This site approaches travel as something experienced over time, not consumed in highlights. Countries are explored through daily rhythms, long walks, local decisions, and the small moments that only show up when you stay a little longer than planned.

Here you’ll find:
- Country‑focused travel stories
- Observations from moving slowly through places
- Lessons learned on the ground, not from itineraries
- Notes on logistics, timing, and travel flow

Some trips include fishing, water, or time spent near the coast or rivers — but those are just one way of connecting to a place. The focus here is always the country itself: how it feels, how it moves, and what stays with you after you leave.
