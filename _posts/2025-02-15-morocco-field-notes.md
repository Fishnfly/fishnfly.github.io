xcerpt: "A slow crossing of Morocco—from cities to desert to coast—showing how landscapes, pacing, and movement shape a deeper travel experience."

Morocco doesn’t reveal itself all at once. It arrives in layers — noise before quiet, density before space, movement before stillness.

This trip wasn’t designed around efficiency. It was shaped around movement: how cities compress time, how distance stretches it, and how attention changes as landscapes open up.

## The Route (Context)

**15 Days**

Casablanca → Rabat → Fez → Erfoud → Sahara (Merzouga) → Aït Benhaddou → Marrakesh → Essaouira → Casablanca

The route mattered not because of the stops themselves, but because of how each transition changed the pace of the days.

## The Itinerary (Reference)

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>View full day‑by‑day itinerary</strong></summary>

**Day 1 · Arrival → to Rabat on Day 4**  
Arrive in Casablanca. The afternoon is unstructured — time to walk, orient, and adjust.  

---

**Day 2 · Tangier & Chefchaouen**  
Travel to Morocco’s northern edge, where Europe feels only an arm’s length away.  
Begin in **Tangier** — whitewashed cliffs, sea light, and the blend of Spanish, Moroccan, and Mediterranean influences that always feels slightly unreal.  
Continue inland to **Chefchaouen**, the Blue City, where everything slows: indigo steps, painted alleys, cats asleep in doorways. It’s an easy place to exhale and let the trip begin gently.

## What Changed as We Moved

Cities compressed time — intense, narrow attention.  
The desert stretched it — silence and distance.  
The coast released it — wind and ease.

---

## Fishing, When It Fit

Fishing wasn’t the focus of this trip. When it appeared, it served as a pause — a way to reset attention rather than measure success.

## Afterthoughts

The itinerary explains movement. It doesn’t explain what stayed with us.  
Those moments lived in the margins, between plans.
