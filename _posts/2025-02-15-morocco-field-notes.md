Morocco doesn’t unfold all at once. It arrives in layers — sound before silence, density before space, motion before stillness.

This trip wasn’t about efficiency or coverage. It was about *crossing* the country deliberately, letting geography and culture set the pace rather than an itinerary.

Before getting into the moments that stayed with us, here’s the framework we moved within.

## The Route (Context)

**February 2–15**

Rabat → Fez → Erfoud → Sahara (Merzouga) → Aït Benhaddou → Marrakesh → Essaouira → Casablanca.

This route mattered less for the stops themselves than for what changed between them.

## What Changed as We Moved

### Cities First  
Rabat and Fez were compressed and vertical. Navigation was constant. Attention stayed outward.

### Then Space  
By Erfoud and the Sahara, time stretched. Distance became visible again.

### And Finally the Coast  
Essaouira felt like a release — wind, light, fewer decisions per hour.

## Fishing, When It Fit
Fishing wasn’t the purpose of this trip. When it appeared, it acted as a pause — water as a way to recalibrate attention, even when nothing was caught.

## Afterthoughts
Looking back, the itinerary mattered less than *how* we moved through it. The days that stayed with us weren’t scheduled — they happened in the margins.
