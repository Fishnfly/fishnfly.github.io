Morocco doesn’t reveal itself all at once. It arrives in layers — noise before quiet, density before space, movement before stillness.

This trip wasn’t designed around efficiency. It was shaped around movement: how cities compress time, how distance stretches it, and how attention changes as landscapes open up.

## The Route (Context)

**February 2–15**

Rabat → Fez → Erfoud → Sahara (Merzouga) → Aït Benhaddou → Marrakesh → Essaouira → Casablanca

The route mattered not because of the stops themselves, but because of how each transition changed the pace of the days.

## What Changed as We Moved

Cities compressed time — intense, narrow attention.  
The desert stretched it — silence and distance.  
The coast released it — wind and ease.

---

## Fishing, When It Fit

Fishing wasn’t the focus of this trip. When it appeared, it served as a pause — a way to reset attention rather than measure success.

---

## Afterthoughts

The itinerary explains movement. It doesn’t explain what stayed with us.  
Those moments lived in the margins, between plans.
