excerpt: "A shift into the modern Gulf—Dubai and Abu Dhabi shaped by ambition, architecture, and engineered horizons."
---

After weeks in Jordan and Egypt—places shaped by stone, river, and ancient time—the UAE felt like stepping into a different frequency. Here the movement wasn’t horizontal but vertical. Light, glass, engineered shadow, and scale shaped the days more than landscape.

Below is the working draft of the story. Refine voice, adjust rhythm, and add images when ready.

## The Route (Context)

Dubai → Old Dubai → Palm Jumeirah → Burj Khalifa → Sharjah → Desert → Al Ain → Abu Dhabi → Dubai

A route defined less by distance than by contrast—old souks, engineered islands, vertical skylines, and the wide desert between them.
