title: "Jordan & Egypt — Field Notes"
categories: [travel]
excerpt: "A movement through Jordan and Egypt — stone, desert, and water shaping the experience more than any single site."
---

Jordan and Egypt didn’t reveal themselves through lists of monuments or scheduled stops. They revealed themselves through movement — over stone, across desert, along water. This trip felt like an unlayering, not of history, but of pace.

Below is the working structure of the story. Refine voice, add images, and adjust rhythm as needed.

## The Route (Context)

Dead Sea → Madaba → Petra → Kerak → Amman → Cairo → Giza → Luxor → Nile Cruise → Aswan → Cairo

A route that moved across valleys, canyons, and riverbanks — one that tied landscapes together more than borders.
